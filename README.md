# Whats the Point?
I'm writing this to help define our working relationship, set expectatations, and invite you to hold me accountable.

# Work Life Balance
I work sometimes on the weekends but it is always my choice. I extend the same permission to you, that you can work whenever you want, but make it your choice. If I message you on a weekend, it can always wait until Monday. If you are working extra hard, I would like that to be driven by passion instead of obligation.

I take vacation and encourage you to take yours! Even when it it has an affect on the team or our output. I firmly beleive that the benefit of taking time off is far above working through it.   

# Core Beliefs

## You
Little that I do is more important than talking to you. If you need to talk to me, I will make myself available. If you think I might say that I don't have time, please don't assume. Let me make the decision on how much time I have because I might prioritize differently then you.

## Feedback
I want to be able to provide you feedback to improve your skills. Conversely I deeply care about you being able to provide me with feedback to improve my skills (technical and otherwise). For more information on my beliefs here, check out [Radical Candor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIh_992Nfes).

## Best Idea Wins
Our work will be better if we can debate with eachother about the best way to do things. I have been wrong in the past and will be many times in the future. I openly invite you to constructively challenge the things I say and the assumptions I make. 

## I Participate
I write code because I like to. I expect you to review my code as deeply as you would anyone elses. If you think it's bad code, I expect you say so. 

## Career Development
The expectation is that you are the driver of your career. I am here to be the best co-pilot you've ever had. I will actively work to support you. Please feel free to guide my assistance as you see fit.

## Safety
If you don't feel that you are safe at work, physically or psychologically, I want to know about it urgently. I consider this a very high priority.

## Humans
I value empathy and the way you treat people greatly matters to me.

## Open
Transparency breeds understanding. You can expect me to be open with anything you ask, as long as I am allowed to talk about it.


# Personal Triggers

## Dead Bodies
I don't believe in hurting others to get ahead. 

## No Comment
I get frustrated when I work to create a positive and safe work environment and people disengage, don't care, and don't have opinions.

# What About You?

I would love to hear more about you and your work and outside work life! Let's chat about it if we haven't already. Really! Knowing how each other works best is critical to a great team.
